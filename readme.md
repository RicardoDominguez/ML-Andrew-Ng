# Machine Learning by Andrew Ng - Programming exercises

Programming exercises in Octave for Andrew Ng's [Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). Please note that I completed this course in Summer 2014, well before starting Uni and as such the exercises may be outdated and you may find more comprehensive solutions out there.

All feedback is welcome. Feel free to give suggestions or raise issues.
